technical aspects of program interoperability.

## motivation

What if all the applications in your computer were written in some hypothetical high-speed python, every running program was an instance of some common base class, and the document i am now editing could be accessed by hopping into python REPL and typing in something like: `text = window_focus_history[-2].app.document.text`? What if filtering out all lines containing "what if" would be as easy as `Grep(input = text, invert_match = True, pattern = 'what if').run()'?

what you can do when writing your app:
## do nothing
Your app possibly takes some command-line arguments. Maybe it has a configuration file in one of the common formats, like INI or YAML. Your app keeps its internal state in variables, unreadable to the user and other programs.
 
## what if we...

A sparql server might be embedded (rdflib) or standalone (a triplestore). In both cases, we can choose to keep updating it continuously, or to only do it when there is a query that needs to be answered. The tradeoffs are fairly obvious:
	* persistence
	* speed
	* memory

A program may also employ different strategies for different aspects or situations. 
For example, a counter in a tight inner loop probably shouldnt be stored in a triplestore.
	

### orm-ed local vars + embedded a sparql server. 
orm-ed in what way?
#### 



3) rdflib add/query, embedded sparql server or eventual update of triplestore 
4) explicit sparql insert/update/select to a triplestore
